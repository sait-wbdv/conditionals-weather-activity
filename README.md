# README

This is a take home activity for practicing working with conditionals, data types, and operators. Feel free to also work on error handling and add functions for an added challenge.

Note that this makes use of the `process.argv()` module in node, which is not available in the browser. For implementation in a client side context like codepen, you'll likely use `prompt()` or an html form.
